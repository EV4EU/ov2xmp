# Export Markdown/PlantUML diagrams with VSCode

The following VSCode extensions must be installed:

- Markdown Preview Enhanced
- PlantUML
- vscode-pdf

Markdown files can be exported to PDFs using the Prince tool. To install prince, just give the following command:
`sudo apt install prince`

Press `CTRL + SHIFT + P` to open the command prompt of VSCode and search for `Customize CSS` to select the respective option. Depending on the drawing characteristics, you may need to customise the PDF generated by prince. An example is provided bellow:

```css
.markdown-preview.markdown-preview {
  &.prince {
    @page {
      size: A4 landscape;
      -prince-shrink-to-fit: auto;
    } 
  }
```

Finally, open the .md file you want to export, generate the preview, right-click on the preview > PDF (prince)
